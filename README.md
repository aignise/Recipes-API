# Recipe Search App

This is a Flask web application that allows users to search for recipes using the Food Recipes with Images API and generate recipe recommendations with the help of OpenAI's GPT-3 model.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You'll also need to install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

# Setting Up OpenAI Assistant Using OpenAI API

Follow these steps to set up your OpenAI assistant using the OpenAI API:

1. **Sign Up for OpenAI API**:
   - Visit the OpenAI website and sign up for an account if you haven't already.
   - Subscribe to the OpenAI API plan that suits your needs.

2. **Get API Key**:
   - Once subscribed, you'll receive an API key. This key is essential for authenticating your requests.

3. **Install OpenAI Python Library**:
   - Use pip to install the OpenAI Python library:
     ```
     pip install openai
     ```

4. **Import OpenAI Library**:
   - In your Python script or environment, import the OpenAI library:
     ```python
     import openai
     ```

5. **Set API Key**:
   - Set your API key using the `openai.api_key` attribute:
     ```python
     openai.api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
     ```

6. **Invoke OpenAI API**:
   - Use the OpenAI API to interact with the language model. For example:
     ```python
     response = openai.Completion.create(
         engine="text-davinci-003",
         prompt="Once upon a time",
         max_tokens=50
     )
     print(response.choices[0].text.strip())
     ```

7. **Explore API Documentation**:
   - Refer to the official OpenAI API documentation for detailed information on endpoints, parameters, and usage examples.

8. **Understand API Usage and Billing**:
   - Familiarize yourself with usage limits and billing details to avoid exceeding quotas and unexpected charges.

9. **Experiment and Develop**:
   - Start experimenting with the OpenAI models, explore prompts, and develop your applications.

10. **Handle Errors and Exceptions**:
    - Implement error handling mechanisms in your code to gracefully handle any errors during API requests.

By following these steps, you can set up and start using the OpenAI API to interact with powerful language models and build innovative applications leveraging artificial intelligence capabilities.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/recipe-search-app.git

2. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Create a `.env` file and add your OpenAI API key:
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

4. Run the Flask application:
python app.py

5. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to access the application.

## Usage

- Enter a recipe query in the search bar and click on the search button.
- The application will display recipe recommendations generated by the OpenAI model based on your query.
